Project Overview
----------------

This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on breast cancer detection using machine learning techniques. The aim is to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. This project was part of my final semester coursework in the Big Data Technology class.

Key Features
------------

*   **Data Handling:** Reading, cleaning, and preparing the Breast Cancer Dataset using pandas.
*   **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    *   Decision Tree Classifier
    *   Support Vector Machine (RBF) Classifier
    *   Support Vector Machine (Polynomial) Classifier (team task)
*   **Feature Importance Analysis:** Using Random Forest to determine feature importance and retraining models after removing less important features.
*   **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrices.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

This project covers:

*   Data preprocessing and handling.
*   Implementation and evaluation of various machine learning models.
*   Understanding of feature importance and its impact on model performance and training time.

Structure
---------

*   **data:** Contains the breast cancer dataset.
*   **scripts:** Python scripts for data processing, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.
*   **results:** Visualizations of decision trees, confusion matrices, and feature importance.
*   **Project 3 Notes.pptx:** Presentation slides detailing the project workflow and results.
